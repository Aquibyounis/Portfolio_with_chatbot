        Iâ€™m <strong>"Aquib Younis"</strong> â€” an AI Engineer on a mission to blur the line between code and cognition.
        <br /><br />
        My world revolves around <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, <strong>Deep Learning</strong>, and <strong>Natural Language Processing</strong>. Whether it's training neural networks, fine-tuning transformers, or building LLM-powered agents â€” I live at the intersection of math, logic, and creativity.
        <br /><br />
        I specialize in creating models that donâ€™t just predict â€” they <em>understand</em>. I design systems that listen, learn, and respond intelligently â€” from personalized AI chatbots to real-time computer vision tools and natural language pipelines.
        <br /><br />
        And while my core lies in AI, I also build the brains **and** the body: integrating models directly into modern web platforms using the <strong>MERN stack</strong>, so everything from the backend to the interface is one unified, intelligent system.
        <br /><br />
        I'm passionate about building a future where apps donâ€™t just work â€” they think.<br />
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Let's code the next frontier of intelligence. âš¡</strong>

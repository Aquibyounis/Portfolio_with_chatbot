        Hi, Iâ€™m <strong>Aquib Younis</strong> â€” an AI Engineer passionate about bridging the gap between code and theory.
        <br /><br />
        I live and breathe <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, <strong>Deep Learning</strong>, and <strong>Natural Language Processing</strong>. Whether itâ€™s training neural networks, fine-tuning transformers, or crafting LLM-powered agents, I thrive at the intersection of logic and creativity.
        <br /><br />
        I focus on building models that donâ€™t just make predictions â€” they <em>understand</em>. From personalized AI chatbots to real-time computer vision systems and natural language pipelines, I design tools that listen, learn, and respond smartly.
        <br /><br />
        But I donâ€™t stop at AI alone â€” I also bring it to life on the web. Using the <strong>MERN stack</strong>, I integrate these intelligent systems directly into full-stack applications, turning standalone models into real-world, user-ready experiences.
        <br /><br />
        What drives me? A vision for a future where applications donâ€™t just work â€” they <em>think</em>.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Letâ€™s build whatâ€™s next. âš¡</strong>

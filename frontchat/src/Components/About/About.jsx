        Hey, I’m <strong>Aquib Younis</strong> — an aspiring AI Engineer who loves blending code with creativity 🪐.
        <br /><br />
        I build smart systems with <strong>LLMs</strong>, <strong>Deep Learning</strong>, and <strong>NLP</strong> — not just to predict, but to <em>understand</em>.
        <br /><br />
        From personal AI assistants to full-stack web integrations with the <strong>MERN stack</strong>, I bring intelligence into real-world apps.
        <br /><br />
        My dream? A project called <em>AY</em> — an AI designed to journey through space and unlock the secrets of the stars ✨.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Let’s build the future. ⚡</strong>

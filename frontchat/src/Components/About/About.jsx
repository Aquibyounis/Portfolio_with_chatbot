        Hi, I’m <strong>Aquib Younis</strong> — an Aspiring AI Engineer passionate developing code and theory🪐.
        <br /><br />
        I love <strong>AI</strong> and <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, <strong>Deep Learning</strong>, and <strong>Natural Language Processing</strong>. Developing LLM-powered agents, I am at the intersection of logic and creativity.
        <br /><br />
        I focus on building models that don’t just make predictions — they <em>understand</em>. From personalized AI chatbots to integrating chatbots into <strong>WEBSITES</strong>, I design tools that listen, learn, and respond smartly.
        <br /><br />
        But I don’t stop at AI alone — I also bring it to life on the web. Using the <strong>MERN stack</strong>, I integrate these intelligent systems directly into full-stack applications, turning standalone models into real-world, user-ready experiences.
        <br /><br />
        What drives me? A vision for a future where applications don’t just work — they <em>think</em>.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Dream Project - </strong>Project <em>AY</em>, a model which is designed to travel into the darkness of space among stars✨ and reveal the secrets of INTERSTELLAR distances.

        <strong>Let’s build what’s next. ⚡</strong>(FUTURE)
